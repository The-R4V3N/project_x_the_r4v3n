 * @brief A customer really wants to have a component to work with files.
 *            And due to PoC, he is agreed to have for now a limitations to work with std::string type for now.
 *            The component should have the following functions:
 *                  read from a file a line of string.read from a file a container of strings.
 *                  write to a file a string, which contains exactly 1 line.
 *                  write to a file a container of strings.
 *
 *             To make our life a bit easier, we can choose what container for string to use ( std::list, std::vector, etc.).
 *             And a customer told us the rule:
 *                  There is only one command on the line.
 *                  The component should be implemented as a library but also have a dummy application, which is working as "echo" ( meaning, if an user called dummy App with a file,the app should call functions to read the file and call functions to write an output file with the same content).
 *                  The component should have UT for the functionality (so plan ahead the code structure to be able to mock specific functions  ).
 *                  The component should also have a component test written on Python.
 *                  The idea is to create a temporary file with predefined input, call a dummy app, compare thegenerated output file with predefined data.).
